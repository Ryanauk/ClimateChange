```
1. Develop a data processing module to load, clean, and normalize climate datasets.
2. Implement machine learning algorithms for climate parameter (e.g. temperature) prediction,
data clustering, and anomaly detection.
3. Create a visualization module with at least three different types of plots to represent climate
data.
4. Design and implement a command-line interface or GUI for user interaction.
5. Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure code reliability.
6. Use Git for version control throughout the development process.
7. Provide clear documentation, including a README file and inline comments.
8. Apply your tool to a real climate dataset and prepare a brief report on your algorithms,
techniques and findings.
9. Design a presentation to demonstrate your work in class that includes running your
application and explaining your design and algorithms.
